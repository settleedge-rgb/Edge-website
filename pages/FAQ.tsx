      q: "Is loan settlement legal in India?",
      a: "Yes, loan settlement is a valid commercial resolution between a borrower and a lender. It is an internal policy decision taken by banks/NBFCs to resolve bad debt. Edge provides consultancy to ensure your case is presented professionally within these frameworks."
    },
    {
      q: "Does settlement suit everyone?",
      a: "No. Settlement is a resolution path typically recommended for those in documented financial hardship. It has a significant impact on your credit history (marking it as 'Settled'), which may affect future credit eligibility for a period of time."
    },
    {
      q: "What is your role as a consultant?",
      a: "Edge provides strategic advisory, document auditing, and drafted communication support. We help you structure your case professionally so lenders can evaluate your resolution proposal clearly. For litigation, we utilize an advocate panel."
    },
    {
      q: "Are resolution outcomes guaranteed?",
      a: "No professional firm can guarantee a settlement. Final approval is always at the discretion of the lender's policy. We focus on maximizing the professional presentation and factual backing of your case to achieve the best possible structured outcome."
    },
    {
      q: "How do you handle privacy?",
      a: "At Edge, client confidentiality is paramount. Your financial data and case history are handled with strict professional ethics and stored within secure systems."
